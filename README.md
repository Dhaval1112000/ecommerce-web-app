# Demo Project: Ecommerce Product Catalogue

**Link to live product:** https://ecommerce-product-catalog-nine.vercel.app/ 

### About the project:

In this project, I have implemented a ecommerce website product catalogue. This is a demo project where I have tried to incorporate best practices for creating a responsive grid/list view with a search filter and sorting functionality. I have also implemented dark/light theme which is automatically set based on browserâ€™s theme.  

Data is fetched from this public endpoint: https://fakestoreapi.com/products

The website is deployed on Vercel

### Technologies:

I have used React + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind CSS for styling, Vercel for deployment, and Axios for API integration.

### Setup:

Follow the steps below to run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository using 

```bash
git clone [repository_name]
```

2. Install all the dependencies 

```bash
npm install
```

3. To run the application 

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Status

The application is still in progress. In the next versions, React redux for global state management I will implement home page, shopping cart, and authentication.

## Thank you!
